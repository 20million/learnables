If you have your code in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`), you can convert it to a Python script (`.py`):

```python
pip install jupyter
jupyter nbconvert --to script your_notebook.ipynb
```

# MNIST Classification with TensorFlow

This repository contains code for building and training a simple feedforward neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow.

## Overview

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels.

The model implemented in this code uses a feedforward neural network architecture with the following layers:

1. Input Layer: Flatten layer to convert the 2D input image (28x28) into a 1D array (784).
2. Hidden Layer: Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation function.
3. Output Layer: Dense layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation function for classifying into one of 10 digit classes.

## Setup

To run the code, you need to have TensorFlow installed. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

## Usage

Run the `mnist_classification.py` script to train the model and evaluate its performance on the MNIST test dataset. The trained model will be saved as `mnist_model.h5`.

```bash
python mnist_classification.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
